# Reflection ✨

After attending the industrial talk, I realized that PPG isn't just a paint company, but they are actually a massive tech engine. I know how the Marine Hull Navigator uses predictive algorithms to save fuelm. It made me realize that the SQL and database theories are the actual tools solving global problems. So, I can study hard on that to increase my competitiveness in job market. Besides, I plan to focus more on building a multi-cloud mindset (Azure and AWS) because PPG showed me that the industry isn't just looking for programmers, but for "problem solvers" who understand how different systems talk to each other.

I suggest adding a "Live Problem-Solving" segment to the session. Instead of just slides, seeing the specific logic or code used to solve a real industry challenge would be much more helpful.
