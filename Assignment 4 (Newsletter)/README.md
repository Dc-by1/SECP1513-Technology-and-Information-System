# Reflection ✨

The visit to Johor Port taught me that ICT is the "digital brain" of heavy industry. I learned how their Active-Active data centers and 50km fiber backbone ensure zero downtime for 24/7 operations. This showed me that high-level infrastructure is just as critical as the software itself to prevent massive losses. In the future, I will adopt their hybrid development strategy. Just as they use low-code for speed and Java for complexity, I will focus on choosing the most efficient tool for my assignments by using rapid prototyping for UI while maintaining deep technical logic for backend systems. This ensures I deliver functional solutions quickly without sacrificing the robustness I saw at the port.

To improve future visits, I think a "live dashboard session" would be much more impactful than just slides. Seeing the actual JPBi system handle a live peak of transactions or watching how the Security Operations Center reacts to a simulated threat would bridge the gap between technical theory and real-world pressure.
