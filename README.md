## Overall Reflection
Taking the Technology and Information System (TIS) course at UTM has been a great eye-opener for me. Before this, I only had a surface-level understanding of IT, but the syllabus really helped me build a solid foundation. I learned how hardware and software work together, how databases organize information, and the basics of networks and system analysis. It was interesting to see how these elements connect to make businesses run smoothly.

What I enjoyed most were the practical activities. The PC Assemble Lab was a highlight， there’s something much more satisfying about assembling RAM, cables and etc than just looking at diagrams in a book. I also learned a lot from the Design Thinking project, which pushed me to work with my teammates to solve real-world problems creatively.

On top of that, the industrial visit and talks gave me a glimpse into the actual tech industry. Seeing how professionals apply these tools in real life made the theories we learned in class feel much more relevant. Overall, this course didn’t just teach me the basics of IT, it actually made me excited about my future career in this field.
