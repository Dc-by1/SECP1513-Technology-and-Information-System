# Reflection ✨

The talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim really shifted my perspective through his 60/40 rule. I realized that while AI tools are powerful, they only account for 40% of a developer's success, and the critical 60% must be a rock-solid foundation in SDLC and architecture. To implement this, I will stop rushing straight into my IDE. Instead, I’ll dedicate more time to the analysis and design phases, mapping out system structures before writing any code. I also plan to prioritize "peopleware" by being more collaborative in team projects and adopting an Agile mindset to handle feedback effectively.

To improve the session, a live demonstration of Agentic Coding would have helped me visualize how to balance AI assistance with manual logic in real-time.
