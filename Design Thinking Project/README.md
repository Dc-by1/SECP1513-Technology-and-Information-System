# Reflection ✨

Through this Design Thinking Project, I learned that solving problems is not just about having good ideas, but about understanding users first. Before this project, I often focused on solutions immediately. However, the empathy stage taught me to listen to users and understand their real experiences and frustrations. This helped me realize that assumptions can easily lead to wrong solutions. The define stage showed me how important it is to clearly identify the core problem. Once the problem was well defined, coming up with ideas became easier and more meaningful. During the ideate and prototype stages, I learned to work better with my teammates and accept different opinions. Building a simple prototype also taught me that it does not need to be perfect at the start.

To improve, we may need to have a good time management to produce a higher quality prototype.
