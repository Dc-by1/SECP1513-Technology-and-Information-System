# Reflection ✨

After attending the industrial talk at UTMDigital, I realized that writing code is actually the easiest part. The real challenge is the disciplined workflow and constant communication needed to push a project to the finish line. Seeing how Agile rituals like sprint planning create professional efficiency changed how I view teamwork, while hearing about failures due to "scope creep" made me realize that even great talent can't save a project without solid documentation and leadership. It hit me that the systems I use daily at UTM aren't just software, but the result of massive, invisible team effort and relentless maintenance.

To improve future sessions, it would be beneficial to have a short live demonstration of the UTMDigital ecosystem's dashboard or real-time monitoring tools to see these theories in action.
